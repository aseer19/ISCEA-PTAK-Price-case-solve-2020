# ISCEA-PTAK-Price-case-solve-2020
I, Aseer Anwar, participated in the global Supply Chain case competition organized by "Mined Mappers Bangladesh" in 2020. It was a good experience to know many things regurding Supply Chain Management(SCM). I wanted to make a good solution to the case, and somehow I along with my whole team earned 70% scholarship from "ISCEA".
i have attached three files containing the case question and solve of the quistion in both dox and pdf
